## Troubleshooting FileZilla Connection Issues

If you're experiencing connection issues with FileZilla, especially when using Wi-Fi or a mobile hotspot, here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the problem:

1. **Check Network Connection:**
   - Ensure that your computer is connected to the correct Wi-Fi network or mobile hotspot.
   - Check if you have a stable internet connection by visiting a website in your web browser.

2. **Firewall and Antivirus:**
   - Firewalls and antivirus software can sometimes block FileZilla's connection. Check your firewall and antivirus settings to ensure they are not blocking FileZilla's access to the internet.
   - Temporarily disable your firewall or antivirus and try connecting again to see if the issue persists.

3. **Check Server Details:**

4. **Passive Mode:**
   - Try switching between active and passive mode in FileZilla's settings. Go to "Edit" > "Settings" > "Connection" > "FTP" > "Transfer Mode" and switch between "Active" and "Passive."

5. **Network Restrictions:**
   - Some networks, especially public Wi-Fi networks, might have restrictions that prevent certain ports or protocols from working. Try connecting from a different network to see if the issue persists.

6. **Mobile Hotspot Troubleshooting:**
   - If you're using a mobile hotspot to connect, make sure that the hotspot is enabled and has a stable connection to the internet.
   - Verify that you have sufficient mobile data or the hotspot is not restricted by your mobile carrier.

10. **Try a Different FTP Client:**
    - If you're still experiencing issues, consider trying a different FTP client to see if the problem is specific to FileZilla.

11. **Contact Support:**
